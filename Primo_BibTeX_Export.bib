abstract = {This article conceptualises the link between firms’ value chains and distribution networks and the requirements for double-materiality assessments in contemporary reporting regulations worldwide. The new European Sustainability Reporting Standards (ESRS) and the standards for sustainability reporting issued by the International Sustainability Standards Board (ISSB), called IFRS S1 and IFRS S2, require companies to report their own direct (scope 1) and indirect (scope 2) greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions as well as GHG emissions in their value chains and distribution networks (both scope 3). However, GHG emissions comprise just one dimension of information that is relevant to understand when assessing, managing and reporting the footprints and impacts of a firm and are, therefore, only a fraction of the key performance indicators (KPIs) related to ESG that should be disclosed. Through a case study, this article demonstrates the connection between a due diligence analysis of a firm’s value chains and distribution networks; an analysis of the competitive parameters of its business model; the identified impacts, risks and opportunities; and the double-materiality perspective. The double-materiality perspective prioritises actions based on probability and significance, creating a natural space to identify KPIs. The implication of this study is that firms can be assisted in identifying relevant KPIs based on double-materiality assessments aided by applying the REGS model because it guides firms in choosing the most relevant KPIs.},

abstract = {The soundness and healthy functioning of financial institutions that contribute to sustainable development by channeling savings into investments has a direct impact on the economy as a whole. The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) cannot be achieved without the strong support of the financial services industry. The novelty of this study is that it investigates the SDGs with ESG indicators through a double materiality perspective for 1888 companies from the OECD financial institutions. This study shows how commercial banks can identify and prioritize the SDGs and targets and how sustainable practices at the corporate level can contribute to achieving these global goals by adopting a sound methodological approach. The empirical results indicate a significant variation between three perspectives including financial materiality, double materiality, and double materiality with fuzzy logic and some of the SASB issues and GRI issues are more material to a particular SDG than others. There are few studies that focus on developing such a multi-perspective methodology, and this study further contributes to the existing knowledge by shedding light on the SDG Impact Index of commercial banks’ with double materiality perspective. In this context, this paper aims to explore the impact of material issues for the OECD financial services industry to achieve the 2030 Agenda’s goal of leaving no one behind.},

@article{Venter2024,
abstract = {We review the recent literature on the assurance of Extended External Reporting published since the review published in 2021 in the Journal of International Financial Management & Accounting. Our review includes 50 articles published between 2020 and August 2023 across 30 journals ranked A*, A, or B on the Australian Business Deans Council 2022 Journal Quality List. We find that the literature continues to be dominated by positivist studies investigating the determinants and consequences of assurance. Studies on determinants examine carbon assurance, ownership, governance, and institutional themes. The consequences studies included in our review examine reporting‐related outcomes and investors' decisions. Other (qualitative) studies we reviewed examine issues such as assurance providers seeking meaning in their work and their attempts to promote assurance beyond merely a verification tool. We highlight several avenues for future research that could inform the work of standard setters and regulators.},
